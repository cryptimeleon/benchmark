# upb.crypto.benchmark
Benchmarking project for the upb.crypto libraries.
Currently allows easy benchmarking of ABE schemes with support for benchmarking sets of attribute/policy pairs.

## Prerequisites

Currently, this project uses Java 8. It also uses Gradle as build system so you will likely want to use an IDE with a Gradle plugin.

## Installation

First, clone this repo in a path of your choice.
Then continue with the installation instructions for the IDE of your choice.

### IntelliJ IDEA

To use the benchmarks, you will want to create a IDEA project. Since this project uses Gradle as its build system, you can create a new project using **File -> New -> Project from Existing Sources**. Then select the `build.gradle` file in the cloned repo folder and continue with the installation.

## Further Information

We also have a [Wiki](https://github.com/upbcuk/upb.crypto.benchmark/wiki). Check it out for further information on how to create and run existing/custom benchmarks.
